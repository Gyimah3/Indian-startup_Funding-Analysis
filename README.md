# Indian-startup_Funding-Analysis
India has been actively fostering the development of a thriving startup ecosystem, and the number of businesses is rising year over year. Due to its favorable startup environment, the nation has drawn a large number of investors, both domestic and foreign. Consequently, a lot of money is invested in the startup sector. Numerous analytical projects have been done on the Indian startup ecosystem. In years past, analysis was conducted to provide answers to a select handful of the many queries. This project stands out since it includes up-to-date data until 2021 on the Indian startup funding environment.
This project's goal is to address some of the most important questions a young entrepreneur might have when deciding to start their firm;
